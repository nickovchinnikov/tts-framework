However, in some models employing full-band mel-spectrograms, an over-smoothing problem occurs as part of which non-sharp spectrograms are generated. To address this problem, we propose UnivNet, a neural vocoder that synthesizes high-fidelity waveforms in real time. Inspired by works in the field of voice activity detection, we added a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs multiple linear spectrogram magnitudes computed using various parameter sets. Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input, we expect to generate high-resolution signals by adding a discriminator that employs spectrograms of multiple resolutions as the input. In an evaluation on a dataset containing information on hundreds of speakers, UnivNet obtained the best objective and subjective results among competing models for both seen and unseen speakers.

This can be represented as a mapping function $f$ such that:</p> <p>$$y = f(x)$$</p> <p>However, the mapping from text to speech is not unique, as there can be multiple valid speech outputs $y$ for the same input text $x$. This is because speech is a complex signal that encodes various types of information beyond just the phonetic content, such as pitch, duration, speaker characteristics, prosody, emotion, and more.</p> <p>Let's denote these additional factors as a set of variation parameters $v$. Then, the mapping function $f$ can be rewritten as:</p> <p>$$y = f(x, v)$$</p> <p>This means that for a given input text $x$, the speech output $y$ can vary depending on the values of the variation parameters $v$. For example, consider the input text <code>x = \"Hello, how are you?\"</code>. Depending on the variation parameters $v$, we can have different speech outputs: - If $v$ represents pitch contour, we can have a speech output with a rising pitch at the end (questioning tone) or a falling pitch (statement tone). - If $v$ represents speaker identity, we can have speech outputs from different speakers, each with their unique voice characteristics. - If $v$ represents emotion, we can have speech outputs conveying different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, or anger. Mathematically, we can represent the variation parameters $v$ as a vector of different factors:</p> <p>$$v = [v_{\\text{pitch}}, v_{\\text{duration}}, v_{\\text{speaker}}, v_{\\text{prosody}}, v_{\\text{emotion}}, \\dots]$$</p> <p>The challenge in TTS is to model the mapping function $f$ in such a way that it can generate appropriate speech outputs $y$ for a given input text $x$ and variation parameters $v$. This is known as the one-to-many mapping problem, as there can be multiple valid speech outputs for the same input text, depending on the variation factors. There are two main approaches to modeling the specific aspects of the variation parameters $v$: 1. Modeling Individual Factors: In this approach, each variation factor is modeled independently, without considering the interdependencies and interactions between different factors. For example, a model might focus solely on predicting pitch contours or duration values, treating them as separate components. While this approach can capture specific aspects of the variation parameters, it fails to model the variation information in a comprehensive and systematic way. The interdependencies between different factors, such as the relationship between pitch and prosody or the influence of speaker characteristics on duration, are not accounted for. 2. Unified Frameworks for Modeling Multiple Factors: Recent research has proposed unified frameworks that aim to model multiple variation factors simultaneously, capturing their complementary nature and enabling more expressive and faithful speech synthesis. In this approach, the TTS model is designed to jointly model and generate multiple variation factors, considering their interdependencies and interactions. For instance, a unified framework might incorporate modules for predicting pitch, duration, and speaker characteristics simultaneously, while also accounting for their mutual influences. Mathematically, this can be represented as a mapping function $f$ that takes the input text $x$ and generates the speech output $y$ by considering the combined effect of multiple variation parameters $v$:</p> <p>$$y=f(x,v_{\\text{pitch}},v_{\\text{duration}},v_{\\text{speaker}},v_{\\text{prosody}},v_{\\text{emotion}}, \\dots)$$</p> <p>By modeling the variation parameters in a unified and comprehensive manner, these frameworks aim to capture the complex relationships between different factors, enabling more expressive and faithful speech synthesis that better reflects the nuances and variations present in natural speech. The unified approach to modeling variation parameters in TTS systems has gained traction in recent years, as it addresses the limitations of modeling individual factors independently and enables the generation of more natural and expressive speech outputs.</p>"},{"location":"review/#two-sides-of-a-coin-ar-vs-nar","title":"Two sides of a coin: AR vs NAR","text":"<p>Any structured data can be transformed into a sequence.

Several issues about this problem are here: * Limited to 13 seconds? * Arbitrarily long text</p> <p>Comment about it from issue #36 Inquiry on Maximum input character text prompt Length:</p> <p>right now the output is limited by the context window of the model (1024) which equates to about 14s. So text should be around that duration (meaning ~2-3 sentences). For longer texts you can either do them one at a time (and use the same history prompt to continue the same voice) or feed the first generation as the history for the second. i know that that's still a bit inconvenient. will try to add better support for that in the next couple of days</p> <p>You can implement the following approach, split sentences and synthesize the audio chunks: <pre><code>from bark import generate_audio,preload_models\nfrom scipy.io.wavfile import write as write_wav\nimport numpy as np\nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download('punkt')\npreload_models()\n\nlong_string = \"\"\"\nBark is a transformer-based text-to-audio model created by [Suno](https://suno.ai/).

The quality of the audio is dramatically reduced, and it generates strange noises, much more often than in the case of generation in order. I found a great description in the comment: output quality seems worse if you pack it like that One more problem that I found is empty sounds if your text chunks are different sizes. Sometimes it's a random noise like background voices etc. So, you need to split the text carefully, it's very important. Bark occasionally hallucinates, which can lead to unexpected and inaccurate results. Unfortunately, it is impossible to detect this issue during the generation process, making it challenging to identify and correct. Furthermore, even during the review process, hallucinations can be difficult to spot, as they may be subtle or blend in with the rest of the generated content. This can result in incorrect or misleading information being presented as factual, which can have serious consequences in certain applications.</p>"},{"location":"review/#note","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Note","text":"<p>I'm still unsure how bark works.

A potential avenue for future exploration could be to integrate the FastPitch model, known for its speed and stability, with the diffusion block from StyledTTS2. This hybrid approach could leverage the strengths of both models. The NAR nature of FastPitch would contribute to the overall speed and stability of the system, while the diffusion-based component from StyledTTS2 could introduce diversity and expressiveness to the generated speech. By combining the efficient and robust FastPitch model with the expressive capabilities of the diffusion-based variator from StyledTTS2, this hybrid architecture could potentially deliver diverse and natural-sounding speech while maintaining computational efficiency and stability.

The suggested <code>learning_rate</code> will be written to the console and will be automatically set to your lightning module, which can be accessed via <code>self.learning_rate</code> or <code>self.lr</code>.</p> <pre><code>from lightning.pytorch.tuner import Tuner\n\n\nclass LitModel(LightningModule):\n    def __init__(self, learning_rate):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.learning_rate = learning_rate\n        self.model = Model(...)\n\n    def configure_optimizers(self):\n        return Adam(self.parameters(), lr=(self.lr or self.learning_rate))\n\n\nmodel = LitModel()\ntrainer = Trainer(...)\n\n# Create a Tuner\ntuner = Tuner(trainer)\n\n# finds learning rate automatically\n# sets hparams.lr or hparams.learning_rate to that learning rate\ntuner.lr_find(model)\n</code></pre> <p>If your model is using an arbitrary value instead of <code>self.lr</code> or <code>self.learning_rate</code>, set that value in <code>lr_find</code>:</p> <pre><code>model = LitModel()\ntrainer = Trainer(...)\ntuner = Tuner(trainer)\n\n# to set to your own hparams.my_value\ntuner.lr_find(model, attr_name=\"my_value\")\n</code></pre> <p>You can also inspect the results of the learning rate finder or just play around with the parameters of the algorithm. A typical example of this would look like:</p> <pre><code>model = MyModelClass(hparams)\ntrainer = Trainer()\ntuner = Tuner(trainer)\n\n# Run learning rate finder\nlr_finder = tuner.lr_find(model)\n\n# Results can be found in\nprint(lr_finder.results)\n\n# Plot with\nfig = lr_finder.plot(suggest=True)\nfig.show()\n\n# Pick point based on plot, or get suggestion\nnew_lr = lr_finder.suggestion()\n\n# update hparams of the model\nmodel.hparams.lr = new_lr\n\n# Fit model\ntrainer.fit(model)\n</code></pre> <p>The figure produced by <code>lr_finder.plot()</code> should look something like the figure below. It is recommended to not pick the learning rate that achieves the lowest loss, but instead something in the middle of the sharpest downward slope (red point).

Switching to mixed precision has resulted in considerable training speedups since the introduction of Tensor Cores in the Volta and Turing architectures. It combines FP32 and lower-bit floating-points (such as FP16) to reduce memory footprint and increase performance during model training and evaluation. It accomplishes this by recognizing the steps that require complete accuracy and employing a 32-bit floating-point for those steps only, while using a 16-bit floating-point for the rest.

If full-band spectral features are used as the input, the vocoder can be provided with as much acoustic information as possible. However, in some models employing full-band mel-spectrograms, an over-smoothing problem occurs as part of which non-sharp spectrograms are generated. To address this problem, we propose UnivNet, a neural vocoder that synthesizes high-fidelity waveforms in real time. Inspired by works in the field of voice activity detection, we added a multi-resolution spectrogram discriminator that employs multiple linear spectrogram magnitudes computed using various parameter sets. Using full-band mel-spectrograms as input, we expect to generate high-resolution signals by adding a discriminator that employs spectrograms of multiple resolutions as the input. In an evaluation on a dataset containing information on hundreds of speakers, UnivNet obtained the best objective and subjective results among competing models for both seen and unseen speakers. These results, including the best subjective score for text-to-speech, demonstrate the potential for fast adaptation to new speakers without a need for training from scratch. </p>"},{"location":"models/vocoder/univnet/readme/#univnet","title":"Univnet","text":"<p>The core module for the training.</p>"},{"location":"models/vocoder/univnet/readme/#generator","title":"Generator","text":"<p>UnivNet Generator.
